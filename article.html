			<h1>Trump Refugee Ban</h1>
			<p>Trump signed that order which suspends the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for 120 days and entry of citizens of countries - Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen for 90 days and from Syria indefinitely, regardless of visa.</p>
			<p>Complexity of issue: ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”</p>
			<p>Bacon ipsum dolor amet Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee.</p>
			<p>You have so many different things placeholder text has to be able to do, and I don't believe Lorem Ipsum has the stamina. Some people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't. I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that wrote Lorem Ipsum, but I don't know, maybe it was. It could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be some wordsmith sitting on their bed that weights 400 pounds. Ok? Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your placeholder text.</p>
			<p>Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites. I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice."</p>
			<p>I think my strongest asset maybe by far is my temperament. I have a placeholding temperament. If Trump Ipsum werenâ€™t my own words, perhaps Iâ€™d be dating it. Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee.</p>

			<p>I will write some great placeholder text â€“ and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me â€“ and Iâ€™ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your websiteâ€™s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. I think the only card she has is the Lorem card. My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women. Be careful, or I will spill the beans on your placeholder text.</p>

Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! If Trump Ipsum werenâ€™t my own words, perhaps Iâ€™d be dating it.</p>

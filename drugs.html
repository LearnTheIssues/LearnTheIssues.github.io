			<figcaption>Here's a nice explanation by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsXVk37bltHxD1rDPwtNM8Q">Kurz</a></a></figcaption>
			<h2>A solid answer from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3v2wh5/eli5_why_has_the_war_on_drugs_been_so_terribly/">Reddit</a></h2>
			<p>There isn't a simple, easy answer to any of this, however:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Punishing the users, not the dealers or distributers.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The USA has the highest rate of imprisonment in the Western world, over 1% of the population is behind bars. This is largely due to the 'zero tolerance' and 'three strikes you're out' policies. A minor criminal (or just a drug user) goes to jail, falls in with criminal gangs and uses more drugs. Gets out, joins up with the gang outside of prison and the cycle repeats.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Lies, damn lies, and worse lies.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>'Pot is a gateway drug'. 'insert evil drug of the decade here? Not even once'. Having the drug education consisting solely of 'Drugs are bad, don't do it' is just... stupid. A hell of a lot of people will try drugs. Although it's yet to be disproven, the 'pot is a gateway drug' was entirely made up by the DEA. If someone tries some illegal substances, finds out that they don't die, they don't get addicted, and see a whole bunch of other people in the same situation, they would start to question all of the other parts of drug education, and probably assume it's all a lie.</p>
			<p>If your basic drug education is fundamentally flawed, how can you expect people to get on board with the rest of the policy</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Making drugs illegal drives them underground. Black market == interest from organised crime</p></li>
				<li><p>Going after drugs is not addressing the issue of drug use.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Just saying 'drugs are the scourge of our city' is missing the point. Why are dealers and addicts prevalent in the poorer sections of society? Poverty, no seeming chance of escape, no programmes to improve society, no programmes to engage children and adolescents.</p>
			<p>I'm not going to start go all conspiracy theory here, stating that it's in the Federal Government's best interest to keep these groups poor and imprisoned, but a statement of fact is that more money is spent on drug enforcement than on education per year.</p>

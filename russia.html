			<!-- <h2>A solid answer from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1p1uyd/eli5_why_are_american_universities_so_expensive/?sort=confidence">Reddit</a></h2>
			<p>There are lots of reasons US universities are expensive. Major reasons are:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><p>US universities are expensive because they're luxury goods (they become more valuable to recipients the rarer they are--if everyone could go to Harvard, a Harvard degree wouldn't mean much anymore). Market economies use price as a signal to buy less of something, but the signal tends to increase the utility of luxury goods.</p></li>
				<li><p>Government support. Tuition prices tend to be followed by ever more generous government supported financial aid (so raising prices tends to be a bit of a race between schools to capture more of the government aid pie). This doesn't help students who don't qualify for aid.</p></li>
				<li><p>Americans tend to view college partly as a fun time to "try out" adult hood. Because they're frequently financing it for a long period of time, the costs of trying out adult hood in a very nice, fun environment has very little cost at the time the decision is made (so colleges respond by building ever nicer services). Spartan living quarters and amenities would greatly reduce the cost of college, but someone who doesn't face the bill for their living quarters for typically 4-5 years is unlikely to be considering thrift very hard.</p></li>
				<li><p>For a long period of time American was a place where just about anyone with a college degree could get a good enough job to pay off their student loans. As degrees have begun to pay less well, students are taking much harder looks at how to reduce their student loan burdens.</p></li>
